wsclient Project
=======================

#### Description
This project allows a user to interact with ESP services in a controlled manner.  The API calls available under org.hpccsystems.ws.client.platform allow for a user to target ESP's across multiple environments running a range of hpccsystems-platform versions.  There is no guarantee that if a user utilizes org.hpccsystems.ws.client.gen generated stub code from wsdl, that the calls will be backwards compatible with older hpccsystems-platform versions.

#### Build
This project is to be built using Maven. To build the projects using Maven, navigate to the base directory of the project and issue the following command:

`mvn install`

Developers who want to do a deployment must insure they have their credentials set in settings.xml under their maven configuration folder.  The following command will execute a clean build of the jar, jar-with-dependencies, javadoc, and source packages.  It will also attempt to sign the packages before uploading them to the sonatype repository for staging.

`mvn clean deploy -P release`

Maintainers can then release the artifacts from staging if the artifacts pass muster.

For more information on how to use Maven see http://maven.apache.org

#### Key elements
